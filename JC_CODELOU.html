<h1> Welcome to the World of John Raymond. . . </h1><p>

      <ul>
        <li> Since the age of 3 I have been attracted to the ideas of design, I first picked up pencils
             and drew on pieces of paper. My father soon saw fit to provide me with Magna doodle, and Etch-a-scetch.
             from there I was hooked.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li> Next I evolved to a V-tech Socrates. using color and shapes, which pushed into
             a Apple Macintosh Performa 575. Next a TI book graced my life, and along the way I developed a passion
             for making and creating beautiful things.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> I pursued Fine Arts and Design at the University of Louisville.
             During that time I confirmed my desire to follow the path of architecture.
             I Pushed my way into the graduate Program at the University of Cincinnati.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li> My ideas were renewed and constantly refreshed, I was more free and less restricted, and
             encouraged to seek and learn more. I then Returned to Louisville Ky, where I resumed Class
             work at Indiana University Southeast. Where I am now Finishing My Masters thesis
             for the Interdisciplinary Studies Program.
